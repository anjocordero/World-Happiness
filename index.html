    <div id="overlay"><h1>World Happiness Report Visulization</h1> <br> <a onclick="off()">Enter</a> <p>The happiness scores use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answer to a question known as the Cantril ladder, which asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale.
      <br>
      <br>
        And the sub-scores under happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.

    <div id="force"><p><text id="heading">a force-directed diagram displays 10 countries with most similar scores in the selected parameter from the parallel coordinate chart for the selected country on the map. The 10 countries are also highlighted on the map with a different color. Users can also hover over the points to see a tooltip that contains the name and data selected and highlight the country in an another different color.

    <div id="parallel"><text id="heading">a parallel coordinate chart displays the ranking, tendency and distribution of the happiness score and other sub-scores numerically. Users could click on each axis of the parallel coordinate chart to select the parameter to display in the force-directed diagram. Also, users could use a brush to highlight a sub-cluster of the entire dataset that takes effect on both the chart and map.
